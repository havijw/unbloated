After considering various available [Hugo themes](), no one seemed to fit within
my requirements and personal style. I wanted something *simple*, *easy to
maintain* but *elegant* at the same time. Therefore, I finally took the
decision of creating my own theme.

To be honest, I am not a professional web designer and my knowledge on [HTML]()
and [CSS]() is limited. Nevertheless, [Hugo static generator]() provided a
simple command for creating a new theme from scratch.

I took inspiration of the layouts and styles from other sites such us:

* Fabien Sanglard's website: https://fabiensanglard.net/
* Xmin theme: https://xmin.yihui.org/

In particular, [Fabien's style
guide](https://fabiensanglard.net/ilike/index.html) was found to be really
useful when devising the fundamental rules on how this site should be styled and
the information being displayed on it.

On the other hand, the approach followed by [Xmin
theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin), which is the one stated in [Hugo's
developer guide]() was ideal to sketch the base layout of *unbloated theme*.

Considering all previous materials, I came across with the following ideas:

* The website skeleton holds three different parts: the banner, the content and
  the footer. This layout is kept the same within every single page of the
  website.

* A "zero-depth" menu is included within the banner having the following default
  pages: Home, Posts, Categories, Tags, Contact and About. Items can be
  customized by user, although new page layouts should be created for those.

* The webpage width is set to a maximum of 800px and only monospace fonts
  apply.

* Images cannot exceed a VGA resolution (640x480). They must be always centered
  and cannot wrap around text (i.e. no floating images).
